This project was built to help jump start Spring MVC projects with Neo4j as a storage medium.  This project already
supports JSR-303 and Internationalization, along with automatic JSON parsing.  There are a few other goodies here, 
Knockoutjs 2.0 release, which is a really cool js library.  There is a docs folder that has some more information on 
the techs used here.
